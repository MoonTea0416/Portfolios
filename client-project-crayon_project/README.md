# client-project-crayon_project

This project is about designing and developing a visual evaluation tool for Newbold’s students to give each other feedback on visual design projects. 
Ideally, students can upload files of visual design projects to then be able to view and evaluate one another within the quiz. This tool is to take the form of a 50 question quiz, broken up into 10 categories. These 10 categories correspond with the “Color CRAYON TIP” acronym. 

The categories are: Color, Contrast, Repetition, Arrangement, ‘Why,’ Organization, Negative space, Typography, Iconography and Photography. Each category has five questions that prompt the user to evaluate the specific design elements of the visual design piece at hand. At a minimum, Newbold hoped that we could create a user interface that met the following criteria:

  * The 50 multiple-choice questions that make up his design evaluation quiz
  * Each possible response is weighted and calculated
  * Only one question is shown at a time during the quiz
  * The interface is coded to be able to calculate a score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 for applicable questions
  * The interface is coded to be able to NOT calculate an N/A response
  * The interface is coded to be able to calculate a final “CCT” score, which is a percentage of applicable responses
  * The interface is coded to be able to calculate and produce a description of where the designer can improve in each of the 10 categories or 50 principles

Additionally, the app implemented thoes funtionalities:

  * User log-in
  * User registration 
  * User can generate project code and start a project evalucations
  * User can upload file inside their own project evaluations
  * User can use others' project code to review others' project and evalute their design
  * 50 quiz can be grabed from database and server will keep track user's progress, calulate socre while user doing quiz
  * When user finish quiz, the app will show final report based on the quiz user did
  * User can choose to send the final report as pdf to the project owner throgh email
 
 
I'm the backend developer of the project. I felt very accomplished and proud of the final product. It was a fun project to work on throughout the semester and it helped me gain a better understanding of the relationship between design and code development. This project gave them a better understanding of the process that it takes to build an online product from start to finish, understanding the concepts and techniques of software design.
