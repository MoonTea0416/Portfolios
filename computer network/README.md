models; transmission environment; technologies; routing algorithms; IP, UDP and TCP protocols;
reliable data transferring methods; application protocols; network security; management systems;

  * Homework 2 is about to build up a DNS server and a DNS client. DNS is the short case for donmain name system, whihc is an application-layer protocol.
Homwwork 2 try to create network application, which consists of a pair of programs -a client program and a server program. Spcififically, the Web server will create a connection socket
when contaced by a client, receive the HTTP request from this connection and parse the request to determine the specific domain name being request and create an HTTP response message 
consisting of the requested data; finaly send the response to the client.

  * Homework 3 is about to build asimple proxy server which services each request in a separate thread, which include a Connection class that is separate thread that services each
 incoming echo client request. It also include a handler class, containing the logic for parsing date between client and server.
 
  * Homework 4 is not coding. It's about some understand of conmputer network knowledge.

  * Homework 5 is about to build up a simple website. It's similar to homwwork 2 but it will return the local resource.

  * Homework 6 is about build a chat server with server and client. And server can services each request in a separate thread.
