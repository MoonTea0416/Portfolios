Educational Software Project: Math Games

This project is an educational math game for 1st and 2nd graders (ages 6-8). It allows students to practice their math skills and teachers to monitor the progress of their students. The math skills covered by the game are:

1. simple addition,

2. simple subtraction, and

3. recognizing places (ones to hundreds)

Our project sought to create an easy to use elementary math game, it challenges students to answer addition and subtraction problems, and identify numbers in tenths and hundredths place. Our goal was to make something easy for teachers and students to use, for instance students log in with their first and last name and can be grouped in a class using a provided code provided by the teacher, students answer multiple choice and fill in the blank questions and their answers are stored on the database, and teachers can manage questions in database using user-friendly interface, monitor studentsâ€™ progress.

I took response to both the backend and frontend for this project. The backend language is Javam anf I build up backend framework using spring boot. The learning curve for learning how to build up a backend server is steep. I met lots of problems and I learned to solved them through tech blog and stackoverflow and developed effective problem-solving skills. 
Working within a team, I learned how to trust and support teammates. I realized that, as a good team member, I need to follow the task divisions, takeing my responsibility. Additionally, I also need to care about others' work progress to make sure everyone is on the same boot. Working both individually and in a group setting is important on a group project.
