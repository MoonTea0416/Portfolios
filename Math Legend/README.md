Educational Software Project: Math Games

This project is an educational math game for 1st and 2nd graders (ages 6-8). It allows students to practice their math skills and teachers to monitor the progress of their students. The math skills covered by the game are:

1. simple addition,

2. simple subtraction, and

3. recognizing places (ones to hundreds)

Our project sought to create an easy to use elementary math game, it challenges students to answer addition and subtraction problems, and identify numbers in tenths and hundredths place. Our goal was to make something easy for teachers and students to use, for instance students log in with their first and last name and can be grouped in a class using a provided code provided by the teacher, students answer multiple choice and fill in the blank questions and their answers are stored on the database, and teachers can manage questions in database using user-friendly interface, monitor studentsâ€™ progress.

This project required me to oversee both the backend and the frontend. Java is the backend language, and I built the backend framework with spring boot. Learning how to design a backend server has a high learning curve. I encountered several challenges and learnt how to overcome them through the use of a tech blog and StackOverflow, which helped me acquire good problem-solving abilities.
Working as part of a team taught me to trust and encourage my coworkers. As a good team member, I recognized that I needed to follow the task divides while accepting responsibility. Furthermore, I must be concerned about the development of others' projects in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page. On a group assignment, it is critical to work both individually and together.
