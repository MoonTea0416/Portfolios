# Machine Learning

This class is an introductory course in machine learning. The class will briefly cover topics in machine learning foundations including when, why, how can machine learn and how can machine learn better, as well as machine learning techniques including linear model, KNN, tree model, SVM, etc.

  * Homework 1 is an implementation of PLA algorithm to find a boundary that can perfectly separate blue points and red points.

  * Homework 2 is an implementation of Pocket algorithm under PLA tofind a boundary that can separate blue points and red points with an appropriate classification error.
 
  * Homework 3 is about One-Versus-One (OVO). This method is used to find a rule that can perfectly separate four types of points. In this homework,  I run PLA six times and then use a rule of majority vote to decide the type of a given new point.

  * Homework 4 is an implement of a nonlinear transformation method. I used the transformation: (x_1, x_2) -> (1, x_1, x_2, (x_1)^2, (x_2)^2)

  * Homework 5 is about the idea of validation.  The hypothesis set of both two models is 10th order polynomial and no regularization is applied. It's obviously to notice that the models are overfitting. In order to improve the model using regularization, we would like to train a model from the dataset using 10-fold cross-validation over hypothesis sets, regularizers, and lambda values. 
  
  * Homework 6 is an implementation of blending and begging. The core idea of this chapter is about how to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. The main hypothesis is that when weak models are correctly combined we can obtain more accurate and/or robust models.
  
  * Homework 7 is about to find a best "horizontal/ vertical" line to seperate blue points and red points.
  
  * Homework 8 is an implementation of decision tree. It is a further move from hw7, the result is a combination of horizontal/ vertical line.

  * Homework 9 is an implementation of KNN.
 
This course involve lots of class group disscussion. We disscussed ideas of algrithm and share our thought during classtime. I think this way to study machine leaning is quite intereting, sometimes students can come up with very good idea during discussion, improving students' criticle thinking and creativity.
Most of assignments of this course are about the implementations of algrithm, which is very chanllged sometimes. Even though they are not easy, they improved my ability of problem solving skills during the process of designing, implementing and testing algrithm.
